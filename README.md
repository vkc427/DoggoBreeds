# DoggoBreeds

Please refer to the dog-API documentation https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/. Using this create an app to list all dog breeds with the appropriate image and name on page 1. And by tapping the specific breed should display the dog images & names for that breed on page 2 as a grid. Once the project is completed please share that in your personal git account and send us the link.
